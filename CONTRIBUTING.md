## Coding

- if you work on something claim with [@<handle>] in the roadmap
- claim whole workpagage if reasonable
- set [âœ“] if sth is done
- everyone gets an invite to letsmeet-click.slack.com - ask @mfa or @asmaps

- as less code as feasible (KISS)
- no django-guardian. ownership/subscriptions by using fk and m2m tables, OLP with django-rules
- derive every model from `django_extensions.db.models import TimeStampedModel`! (created is important for KPIs)
- write tests(TM) for added functionality
